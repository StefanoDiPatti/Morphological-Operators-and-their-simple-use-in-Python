# Morphological Operators and their simple use in Python
 In the context of image processing the term morphology mathematics denotes the study of geometric structure of the image. It is a useful tool for representation and description of the shape of a region. They can draw the contours, the skeleton, etc. It is a mathematical tool initially defined on binary images but easily extensible to images a shades of gray and then in color. In this presentation we will focus directly only on binary images. The image used is a 160x120 pixels, black-white and asymmetric. Operators will be discussed in theory as well as in practice by using the famous library OpenCV. For all techniques other than the image, a kernel structuring element is used to slide across the image. The structure of the image is “probed” with a user predet shape usually encoded from a small raster image (3×3 o 5×5). The structuring elements are defined relatively an origin (typically, it is the center of gravity). We can make use of NumPy’s ones() function to define a kernel.
